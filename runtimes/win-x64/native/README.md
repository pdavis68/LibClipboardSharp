# Native Library Placeholder

This directory should contain the native libclipboard library for Windows x64.

**Required file:** `libclipboard.dll`

## Building from Source

To build the native library from source:

1. Clone the libclipboard repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jtanx/libclipboard.git
   ```

2. Follow the build instructions for Windows in the repository

3. Copy the resulting `libclipboard.dll` to this directory

## Pre-built Binaries

Alternatively, you can obtain pre-built binaries from:
- The libclipboard releases page
- Third-party package managers
- Build them yourself following the project's documentation

**Important:** Ensure the binary is compatible with your target architecture (x64) and .NET runtime.
